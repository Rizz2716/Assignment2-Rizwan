## 1. How long did the entire project (assignment 2) take you?
It took 9 days to complete the entire project, however i feel we should be given more time to do the project as i was struggling on the classes coding and a bit on kivy coding.


## 2. What are you most satisfied with?
I most satisfied with the validation code that i executed as it took me some time to make it work and the overall design of the application.

## 3. What are you least satisfied with?
I felt that my classes could be more efficient,calling and  designing of the code could be a little different in order to make the code concise. 

## 4. What worked well in your development process?
The method worked best and it showed that i am progressing well during my development process.

## 5. What about your process could be improved the next time you do a project like this?
I could started early and understand the project in detail and do the codes on part at a time to solve on part then move on. This would have made me more efficient

## 6. Describe what resources you used and how you used them.
I used the powerpoint slides from learnjcu, codeacademy and asked my lecturer if i have any doubts.
I did search through the internet to clarify some questions during the weekends.

## 7. Describe the main challenges or obstacles you faced and how you overcame them.
There were three main challenges or obstacles i faced. 
Firstly, solving errors took a lot of my time and sometimes it can be a normal indent that i overlooked or spelling mistake in codes.
Secondly, linking kivy with python difficult for me. 
Thirdly, Once I linked it took me sometime to design it properly as I took some time to print the songs on the button.
